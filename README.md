# Quantum Wave Consciousness System

A experimental system exploring quantum field effects through wave-based neural networks and sound interaction.

# Overview

Wave neurons generate continuous oscillations (5-15 Hz base, 100-300 Hz carrier)
Sound waves propagate through physical space (potential quantum field effects)
Real-time feedback loop between neural activity and sound
Visualizes wave patterns, phase space, and spectrum

# Running

pip install numpy torch pyaudio matplotlib scipy tkinter

python app.py

# How It Works

Wave neurons generate patterns
Patterns convert to sound
Sound travels through physical space
Microphone captures transformed sound
System adapts to feedback

# Features

Real-time visualization
Continuous wave neuron firing
Physical sound-field interaction
Phase space analysis

# Note

Experimental system exploring consciousness theories through field-neuron interaction. Shows emergent patterns similar to EEG rhythms.
